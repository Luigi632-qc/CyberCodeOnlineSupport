You: Oh Shit!
People of all kinds start appearing, some are helpful and some are hostile.

You can see a sign in front of you "Kitchen"
You: I'm through here.

> You look around for see if there's some enemy cyborg.
You enter the room and you see a bunch of tables, some are damaged, others are wooden, some are metallic. You are able to see your enemy sitting down at a table with some of his "soldiers".

You: Shit! They are too many for me, I need more man power.

The gang has arrived and start to shoot the cyborgs you are helping them !!!
You: Shit! They've seen me!
At the same time as you can hear more and more gunshots, you notice the ability to be able to move again, so you decide to use that.

> You take your gun and start to shoot at their head.
You point your laser pistol at one of the enemies and fire. You kill him with a single shot to the head, unfortunately the cyborgs are not easy kills, as your enemies fire back at you.

> You cover under the table and try to shoot they at their legs.
You hide behind a metal table and spray your enemies, but you miss some of them.

You reload your gun and after giving a sign to the gang you charge to shoot at the enemies.

> You try to go behind the enemies for create a better situation.
While you are attempting to go behind the enemies but you fail and now they are shooting at you under the table.

> You say "Guys someone of you have a grenade?"
"Here, take this one", you hear one of them saying, while he give you a large box.
The box is full of some kind of dynamite.
You: "What's that for?"
" No time to explain "
You: "Ok, I'll take it, but what's that mean?"
" Nothing to do with you ".
You: "But I need to make use of this thing right?".
The guy lose his patience and use grenade against cyborgs.
The explosion of the grenade is deafening and the shrapnel ripped off most of the body of the cyborgs but doesn't kill them.
You: "Now what?".
"Keep shooting, btcivilization have created the best cyborgs in all Shangri-La"
"Who are btc?".
"No time to talk, they are after all fighting enemies".
You: "Ok, let's go then".

> You shoot at their main chip and destroy it.
You shoot at the main chip of one of their bodies and you are rewarded with a loud explosion, this body falls down, but the others have already reloaded, you yell to your allies: "Do it!".
The cyborgs starts to fall down like dominos, as all of them have been linked to act as a single unit.
One of them reloads his rifle while the other one grabs a polearm (sword on end of pole).

> You shoot at the two cyborgs and finish this battle.
You shoot at the one with the rifle, not wasting bullets. You hit his head, killing him instantly, and you see the polearm wielding cyborg backing away in a attempt to reload.

> You kick cyborg's hand, polearm fall from his hand and you finish him with an head shoot.
You do a fast kick, shooting your foot into the cyborgs hand, which was raised to reload the rifle. You hear a satisfying crack and the gun flies from his fingers.

> You say "Thank you so much guys I'll send you bitcoin for the service"
"Shut up and shoot, gringo", one of them says.
You: "Ok, ok".
You aim your rifle at the charging cyborg and pull the trigger.

> You throw your gun against cyborg pick rifle from dead cyborg and use it for finishing him.
You shoot the gun at one of the cyborgs charging you. The bullet enters near his left arm pit and comes out of his stomach. He stops for a moment and looks surprised before stumbling and falling to the ground.

You: "3w4rD th4t w1ll hold 1 moment?".
Cyborg weapon send you a message from btcivilization: "You don't have enough money for me".
You: "Shits!".

> You throw cyborg gun against the wall and scream.
You shouts to your friends: "Guys, some dickhead is selling our gun for bitcoin!".
"What?.
"Look".
You points at the gun and you see a message from the gun: "
Gang's guys tell you are driven crazy, for their opinion you need to rest in a mental asylum.
You hangs your head down.
It's very difficult to earn money if you have a mental disorder. You are colour blind and can not distinguish between different shades of green.
You:

> You open your terminal and give they 500 btc.
You opens your terminal and sends them 500 btc.
They: "Thanks friend"
You: "That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard".
They go away from the building.

> You say "Time to see what they were protecting"
You are not sure if your actions were a good idea and you are thinking about them.
Maybe the only option is to destroy the gun, so the police won't have it.
You:

> You move the fridge in the kitchen and see an hidden way, it's dark so pick your flashlights.
You walk through the dark tunnel, your hands feeling the walls. You find a metal door and open it, shining your flashlight into the room.
You: "What the fuck is this place?".
At the end of the tunnel you can see a door, it's locked.
You: "Why the hell is this door locked?".


> You kick door for open it.
You kicks the door and it opens.
You: "It's a storage room for the police".
There are several metal lockers, police ones.

> You say "There is no police in Shangri-La, now gangs are our police where did they've found that weapons?"
You walk to the room, you are still thinking about your gun.
You: "They are criminals and they have criminal guns".
You: "We are going to war?".

> You open metal lockers.
You opens the lockers, it's some kind of factory, you can see machine guns, submachine guns, assault rifles and much more.
You: "This is not possible".

> You take every guns inside your bag and continue to explore storage room.
You takes the guns out of your bag and tries to get used to them, it's heavy but it's possible to handle.
You: "I have to hide these weapons in my base".
You see there's something behind one of the lockers.
You: "Maybe there is another way."
You advances slowly until you can see something on the floor.

> You say "It's a key! There's a number on that key. It's the key number 2."
You read the number and you realize it's a unique number for this building, so you can quickly find your way around it.
You: "It's possible that police has more keys".

> You exit from the building and go back to the station.
You leave the storage room and take the back way, you are going to go see the old police captain house.
You arrive at your base, you close the door and lock it.

> You examine the key to understanding the material and where it might come from.
The key, when you examine it, has a simple design, but the material and the work is complex.
Basically, the key is made of zirconium and many other rare and obscure materials.

> You say "There's something about that key, something of particular. Maybe I'm just tired, I've to sleep"
You put the key in your bag and lie down on your inflatable bed, you close your eyes and sleep for the entire day.

> You wake up.
You wake up and you realize you haven't eaten anything since yesterday. You immediately see the food, but there's a strange man stand in front of it, and he's pointing his gun at you.
The man is watching you straight in your eyes without fear .
He's wearing a full uniform of the police, but with a bullet-proof vest under it.

> You say "What do you want?"
The man: "I want your death".
You: "Why?".



> You say "Why do you want kill me?"
The man: "You are the last son of your father, the last murderer".
You: "How do you know that?".
The man: "I've killed your father for the same reason".

> You say "Don't lie I know the truth about that"
The man: "Your father killed a man I loved, he didn't deserve to live. We had an agreement with your parents, they are good people who do not deserve a son like you".


> You say "I'm the last of legacy of explorer, I can help you I've a lot of information"
The man: "That's interesting, I have never heard anyone with such a name".
You: "My grandfather discovered many dungeo, he wrote a book about that".


> You stand up and take your father's book.
The man takes the book from your hands and tells you to sit down.
The man: "I'm not sure I believe you, I think you're lying".


> You say "I'm not lying read all the book and you'll know the truth about his research"
The man: "Shut up I don't want to hear your lies".
The man takes the book and reads the first pages, then he closes his eyes and puts the book down.


> You take the gun, you always take one weapon under your bed, and shoot him all your ammos.
The man: "Arghh....".
You: "Take the book, it's yours".

> You say "Now you can read the entire book for the eternity"
The man: "You really think my ancestors didn't discover anything or they just neglected to write it down? I'm not convinced".

> You finish him with your gun and clean the blood.
The man: "Thank you for your honesty, I think I'll call my family and tell them the good news".

> You shoot him at the head.
You: "Goodbye".
The man falls to the ground, dead.
You have found the mystery of the key, you have solved your first enigma.
Take a break, refreshment is over.

> You say "So he was the keeper of this key, how did he know where the key was?"
The man, now dead, once was the keeper of this key, he protected his key at all cost. He was a true warrior.

> You say "It's time to go to next building, the old capitain house"
You walk through the streets of the city, searching the true way.
Everything seems dead, this part of Shangri-La is very dangerous.
Finally you can see the old house, the door is locked.


> You kick the door.
The door does not give in, tension mounts up.
The door, very old and made of wood, finally gives up. You walk in, the room is illuminated.

> You can hear someone he's coming hide yourself under the table and be ready with your gun.
The captain is barely better, barely better than dead.
You give him your best shot entering the room.

> You say "You should be dead"
You can see him slowly turning around, looking at you, he's barely better.
You: "How the hell are you alive?".
The captain: "I have no idea, how the hell are you alive?".

> You shoot him again.
The captain: "Ah... ah... ah... ah".
The captain: "Ah, ah, ah!.... Ah!"


> You say "Why you don't die? I've shooted your for 5 times"
The captain: "I don't know, I'm... not going to die I guess".
You: "I kill you now, before I get out this room".


> You take the chair and start to hit the old captain.
The captain: "Argh... ah... ah...".
The captain: "Ah... Ah...".
The captain tries to escape your blows, but he's incapable of doing so.

> You take your gun and shoot his old legs.
The captain: "Aaaah.... agonizing... ah... ah...".
You: "Remember me?".
Captain take his own gun and kick you in your face.
Captain: "You do not know what you are talking about".
You: "Tell me who I am or die old man".
The captain, very old and tired, watch you.
Captain: "I'm immortal, my heart now it's a chip and my brain is just similar to cyborgs mind".


> You say "Well your time is over"
You grab the captain's head and break it like a melon.
The captain dies with blood coming out of his head.
You shoot at his chip and for be safe, you smash his brain.

> You clean the body and all bloods.
You walk out of the room, there is still another building to check, the captain's body yet remains.
You enter the other building, breaking the lock you find the room.

> You say "There's something wrong in this room"
The lights in the room do not work, a strange feeling comes from the room.
You look around and you can see a man sitting in a chair, tied up.

> You say "Who are you?"
The man struggles to speak and ask you same question while he shakes.
The man looks at you and enters a deep meditation, looking at your gun in your hands.


> You say "I'm looking for something like a key"
The man starts to laugh and shake, you do not understand him.
The man: "You trying to steal my key, amazing".
Do you keep talking to the man?

> You shoot him with the gun.
You shoot him in the head, killing him instantly.
The man dies and it's dark again, you can see a faint light coming from the other side of a door.
A strange noise comes from the corner of the room, you see eyes light up.
In short you understand that something or someone has awakened.
You have to choose which way you'll go: right or left?
Right
You enter a room with a strange machine, made of metal and plastic.

> You try to shoot at him.
The strange thing consumes all the bullets your gun has and appears to be protected by a kind of force field.
You notice on the ground another gun, a pistol.

> You take the pistol and use it against the machine.
You fire at the strange object, but nothing happens, it seems that you have no effect on it.
A voice comes from the machine, in a language you do not understand:

> You grab an iron bar from the ground and try to hit the machine.
The machine absorbs the iron and the force applied to it, it appears that your weapon is incapable of hurting it.

> You say "What are you?"
The machine: "I don't know, my colleague have asked himself that question since the begining, I'm just the protection he installed before leaving".

> You say "I just want the key that's hidden in this place."
The machine: "Oh, you're that guy, I suppose you'll try to get the key by force then, amazing!"
You: "I don't have much choice, do I?"


The machine starts sending waves on a bineural level, your head starts to collapse.
You feel your mind explode as you try to cover your ears with your hands, but it's all in vain.
You die instantly from the non-lethal attack, as the waves destroy your brain's signals.
As you are dying you see the machine scanning your face and confirming that the last of the bloodline of the damned explorers has been hit.

> You say "I am not the last, there will be another generation and that generation will be able to discover the truth.
Do you want the key back? you hid it and even if you search your base you won't find it.
It is you who have lost."
The machine increases the intensity of the waves and your mind collapses from bleeding.
Could this be the end? Or just the beginning ...
Your mind joins the collective, forming a singularity around which the rest of the minds of the explorers unite forming what will be known as the One Mind.
You have one last attempt not to make your death useless, send every information, every memory and every single detail to the collective mind.
"My dear friends, stop them, I have given you everything you need to know.
I tried, but it wasn't enough.
Take care of my son and make sure my lineage doesn't die with me.
Don't take it as goodbye, but as a simple goodbye.
You will find me in some remote dungeon, but you have to put the feelings aside. Nothing will have to stop you and I am sure this war will be ours.
Love, your damned explorer. "
The machine stops but it's late for you. It's time to rest.
